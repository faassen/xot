## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Changes

- Changed representation of attributes and prefixes from
  `std::collections::BTreeMap` to use `VecMap` from `vecmap-rs`. This has the
  benefit of retaining the original definition order. Note that `vecmap-rs` is
  a different implementation than `vector-map`, which Xot used until version
  0.14. `vecmap-rs` offers an ordering guarantee, while `vector-map` doesn't.

  This could cause some breaking changes if there are differences in the map
  API, or if you used the `BTreeMap` type directly instead of Xot's
  `Attributes` and `Prefixes` type.

## [0.17.0] - 2023-11-13

### Changes

- Add `xot.parse_with_spans()` which besides parsing the tree also returns a
  `xot::SpanInfo` which maintains span information. The span information
  becomes invalid as soon as you mutate a Xot document.

- Add `xot.outputs` to get serialization output tokens out without rendering
  them. This can be useful if you want to process these tokens with an external
  parser.

## [0.16.0] - 2023-09-07

### Changes

- Add `xot.following()` function. This returns all nodes that follow a node in
  document order, not including the node itself or any of its ancestors or
  descendants.

- Add `xot.preceding()` function. This returns all nodes that precede a node in
  document order, not including the node itself or any of its ancestors.

## [0.15.0] - 2023-09-06

### Changes

- Add `xot.namespace_for_prefix()` function to look up namespace in the context
  of a node.

- Add `xot.namespaces()` function that returns an iterator that iterators over
  non-overridden `(prefix, namespace)`` pairs in the scope of a node.

- Add `xot.advanced_compare()` function that lets you compare two nodes with a
  node filter and with a custom text/attribute value comparison.

## [0.14.0] - 2023-08-24

### Changes

- Support for XML documents with other encodings than just UTF-8 and US-ASCII.

- Do not use `VecMap` anymore to store attributes and namespace prefixes.
  Instead store attributes in a `std::collections::BTreeMap`, which should
  behave similarily for small amounts of attributes.

  This is a potentially breaking change when accessing `prefixes` or
  `attributes` on a XML value, but the map API compatibility should in fact be
  improved.

  This can also change the order in which attributes or namespace declarations
  are serialized, which is not a semantic change of XML but may break certain
  tests.

## [0.13.5] - 2023-06-29

### Fixed

- There was a stray debugging print that caused output when parsing CDATA.
  This has been removed.

## [0.13.4] - 2023-06-29

### Fixed

- `deduplicate_namespaces` had a bug. Attributes, unlike elements, can only be
  in a namespace if they have an explicit prefix; there is no defaulting. This
  means that a prefix definition for a duplicate namespace can only safely be
  removed if this prefix doesn't overlap with a default namespace, or if the
  prefix is not in use by any attribute. We now check for this.

## [0.13.3] - 2023-06-26

### Fixed

- We were incorrectly doing entity parsing inside CDATA sections. This caused
  `&` to be rejected as incorrect in such a section, but it should be
  acccepted. Now we accept the text in these sections as-is instead and don't
  try to do any processing on them. Thanks to dsrich for the report! Fixes
  https://github.com/faassen/xot/issues/3

## [0.13.2] - 2023-05-02

### Added

- Make Xot a bit more generous about what encodings it supports: lowercase `utf-8` is
  accepted, as well as `us-ascii`. Note that `us-ascii` at present is handled just
  like `UTF-8`, and no invalid ASCII is detected by the parser.

## [0.13.1] - 2023-03-23

### Added

- New `xot.level_order()` method to traverse the tree in level order.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-02-23

### Added

- New `xot.xml_space_name()` to access the `NameId` of the
  `xml:space` attribute.

### Changed

- `remove_insignificant_whitespace` now respects `xml:space="preserve"`.

- Pretty printing now also respects `xml:space="preserve"`.

- Expose `inherited_prefixes` method which gets the prefixes that a node
  inherits but does not define locally.

## [0.12.1] - 2023-02-15

### Changed

- Proptest won't create carriage return as text content anymore, as
  that is supposed to be normalized by XML anyway.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-02-08

### Added

- Expose `no_namespace`, `empty_prefix`, `xml_namepace` and `xml_prefix`
  methods.

### Changed

- Xot doesn't take a lifetime specifier anymore.

- The lifetime restriction on `Xot.add_name` and `Xot.add_name_ns` has been
  lifted; you can now pass in more short-lived names. Internally `Cow` was
  previously in use to store names, but that was a minor optimization far more
  trouble than it was worth.

## [0.11.8] - 2023-02-07

### Added

- Added `remove_insigificant_whitespace` to the `Xot` API. This removes
  insignificant whitespace nodes from the tree.

## [0.11.7] - 2023-02-01

### Added

- Added `is_prefix_defined` to the `Xot` API to check whether a prefix is
  defined in the context of a node.

- Added `prefix_for_namespace` to the `Xot` API to get a defined prefix for
  that namespace in the context of a node, or `None` if it isn't defined.

## [0.11.6] - 2023-02-01

### Added

- Added `unresolved_namespaces` to the `Xot` API. This gives namespaces that
  aren't defined by prefixes within the given node or its descendants.

- Changed the behavior of `clone_with_prefixes` to be more accurate: it only
  includes prefixes for unresolved namespaces, not any additional ones.

## [0.11.5] - 2023-01-26

### Added

- Added `compare` and `compare_ignore_attributes to the `Element` API. This
  allows you to compare two elements semantically, with the option to ignore
  some attributes during the comparison.

- Added `xot.compare_children`. This allows you to compare the children of
  two element nodes, even though they may have different names or attributes.

## [0.11.4] - 2023-01-17

### Fixed

- Fixed another bug with text node consolidation; `xot.clone` is now robust
  against text node consolidation.

## [0.11.3] - 2023-01-17

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with text node consolidation. In some cases when using insert
  before or insert after, a node was not properly consolidated.

## [0.11.2] - 2023-01-16

### Added

- Make `xot::Value` hashable. This means `Element`, `Text`, `Comment`, etc are
  now hashable too.

## [0.11.1] - 2023-01-13

### Added

- Added the ability to turn off text node consolidation. Use
  `Xot::set_text_consolidation(false)` to turn it off or on again.

## [0.11.0] - 2023-01-13

### Added

- Add pretty printing support. You can use `Xot::with_serialize_options()` to
  turn on pretty printing before serialization.

- Added a `Xot::tokens` and `Xot::pretty_tokens` API to extract raw serialized
  XML for custom rendering. This replaces the `SerializerWriter` API.

### Breaking changes

- Revised the serialization API yet again as it was getting too complicated:

  - To serialize any node (including the root) to a `Xot::to_string`. This
    replaces `Xot::serialize_to_string` and `Xot::serialize_node_to_string`.

  - Serialization never takes a mutable self anymore.

  - To write to a `Write`, use `Xot::write`. This replaces `Xot::serialize` and
    `Xot::serialize_node`.

  - Previously serialization to string did not return an error. This has been
    changed so that an error is returned as well.

  - Serialization now errors if a namespace URI is encountered with a missing
    prefix. This can be fixed by calling `create_missing_prefixes` just before
    serialization, but you need to do this manually; it won't be automatic
    anymore.

- Removed the `SerializerWriter` trait introduced by `0.10.0`, and
  `serialize_with_writer`. The required functionality (and more) is now exposed
  through `Xot::tokens` and `Xot::pretty_tokens`.

## [0.10.3] - 2023-01-09

### Changed

- We still haven't gotten the serialization right. The `SerializerWriter` was
  taking fullname parameters, but that breaks expectations. Instead let the
  `SerializerWriter` own the fullname serializer so it can construct names as
  needed.

## [0.10.2] - 2023-01-09

### Changed

- `serialize_with_writer` now only takes an immutable self, and it's the only
  way to serialize with a writer. It does not attempt to add missing prefixes
  anymore.

## [0.10.1] - 2023-01-09

### Added

- `namespace_for_name` to allow access of the namespace id of a particular
  name.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-01-09

### Added

- New `serialize_with_writer` and `serialize_node_with_writer` methods. These
  can be used to customize the XML write process using the new
  `SerializerWriter` trait. The `StringWriter` struct is also provided and is
  useful to implement this trait.

### Changed

- `serialize` and `serialize_node` now do return an error object, as IO may
  go wrong during the underlying write process and we don't want to hide this.

## [0.9.2] - 2023-01-05

### Fixed

- Now actually working `xot::proptest::arb_xml_root_with_config`.

## [0.9.1] - 2023-01-05

### Fixed

- Fixed incomprehensible text in `element_unwrap` error.

### Added

- Added `xot::proptest::arb_xml_root_with_config` which allows configuration of
  what is generated. Right now you can only turn on or off generation of
  comments and processing instructions outside of the document element.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-01-05

### Added

- `proptest` support. If you enable the `proptest` feature you can use
  `xot::proptest::arb_xml_root` in your own proptests. This generates a
  arbitrary XML document out of a fixed set of elements, attributes, namespace
  prefixes and namespaces.

- Elements in the Xot tree are now more lightweight now as they don't
  carry an inverse map of namespace to prefix anymore.

### Fixed

- Rework the way serialization works for namespaces, fixing various bugs
  surrounding serialization of missing prefixes.

### Removed

- Remove the `get_prefix` method on `Element`. A namespace can have multiple
  prefixes, and the API isn't really very useful.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-01-02

## Added

- `text_content_mut` and `text_content_str` now work with elements without
  any content too.

## Fixed

- Previously we couldn't wrap standalone elements with `element_wrap`, now we
  can.

## [0.7.1] - 2022-12-22

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in `compare`: if values were the same but the structure was
  different, compare incorrectly returned `true`.

## [0.7.0] - 2022-12-21

### Added

- Lots of examples in the API docs.

### Breaking

- `new_root` has changed and requires you to pass in an element. This is
  because otherwise you could inadvertently create XML documents that are
  not allowed - a document element is required.

## [0.6.1] - 2022-12-20

### Added

- It's now possible to call `element_wrap` on the document element as well.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-12-20

### Added

- It's not possible to apply `element_unwrap` to the document element,
  if and only if it has a single child node that's an element.

- It's allowed to use `replace` on the document element as well, if it
  doesn't break the rule and the document element remains.

- Added new `is_document_element` accessor to check whether a node
  is the document element.

## [0.5.1] - 2022-12-16

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where we couldn't clone a document root.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-12-16

### Added

- Made built in escaping rules less aggressive for serialization; text values
  now only escape `<` and `&`, and attributes escape those and `'` and '"`.

- `xot.new_root()` which allows you to create a new document from scratch
  without parsing.

- `xot.text_content`, `xot.text_content_mut` and `xot.text_content_str` for
  convenience access to the text content of an element.

- `xot.compare` which allows you to compare two nodes for semantic equality.

### Performance

- More efficient handling of lookup of name, prefix ids and namespace ids.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-12-14

### Added

- Export `ToNamespace` and `Attribute` types.

- Add documentation for `NodeEdge` variants.

## [0.3.2] - 2022-12-13

### Fixed

- `serialize_node_to_string` generated duplicate namespace declarations.

## [0.3.1] - 2022-12-13

- Make `NameId`, `PrefixId` and `NamespaceId` have `Ord`.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-12-13

- Add new `name_ns_str`, `namespace_str` and `prefix_str` methods to access
  name information.

- Changed the processing instruction API to not use `get_target` and
  `get_value` but instead to use `target()` and `value()`.

- Make `NameId`, `NamespaceId` and `PrefixId` public.

- Documentation tweaks.

- Tweak `Cargo.toml`

## [0.2.0] - 2022-12-12

Initial public release.
